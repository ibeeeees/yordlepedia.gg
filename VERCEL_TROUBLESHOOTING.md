# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

Your code works locally but Vercel isn't deploying it. Here's the nuclear option to fix it:

## Option 1: Remove & Reimport Project (Recommended)

1. Go to **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Click **yordlepedia-gg** project
3. Click **Settings** (top menu)
4. Scroll to bottom → Click **"Delete Project"**
5. Confirm deletion
6. Go back to dashboard
7. Click **"New Project"** or **"Add New"** → **"Project"**
8. Click **"Continue with GitHub"**
9. Search for `yordlepedia.gg` 
10. Click **Import**
11. When asked for build settings, leave as default
12. Click **Deploy**
13. It should auto-deploy!

## Option 2: Force Redeploy (If you don't want to delete)

1. Go to **https://vercel.com/dashboard**
2. Click **yordlepedia-gg**
3. Go to **Settings** → **Git**
4. Look for **"Redeploy on push"** - make sure it's **ON**
5. Go to **Deployments**
6. Find the OLDEST failed deployment
7. Click **...** → **Redeploy**
8. Watch the logs - they should show code from latest commits

## Option 3: Push a New Commit

Push a new commit to trigger auto-deploy:
```bash
cd /Users/ibe/WebstormProjects/yordlepedia.gg
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Vercel deployment - force refresh"
git push
```

Then check Vercel dashboard - new deployment should start automatically.

## Verify GitHub Connection

Before trying above, verify GitHub is connected:

1. **Vercel Dashboard** → **yordlepedia-gg** → **Settings** → **Git**
2. Look for **"Connected Repository"** section
3. It should say **"ibeeeees/yordlepedia.gg"** ✅
4. If it says **"Not connected"** ❌ → you need Option 1

## What You're Waiting For

Once deployed, you should be able to:
✅ Search for summoners  
✅ See privacy page at `/privacy`  
✅ See TOS page at `/tos`  
✅ API calls work: `/api/summoner?region=na1&name=ibes`

## Emergency - Use Vercel CLI

If web dashboard isn't working, use the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
cd /Users/ibe/WebstormProjects/yordlepedia.gg
vercel --prod
```

This manually uploads your entire project to Vercel!

## After Redeployment

1. Clear your browser cache (Cmd+Shift+Delete)
2. Visit **https://yordlepedia-gg.vercel.app**
3. Try searching for a summoner
4. Check `/privacy` and `/tos` links in footer

Let me know which option you try and what the status is!
