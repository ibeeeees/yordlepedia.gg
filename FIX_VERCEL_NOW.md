# URGENT: Manual Vercel Redeployment Instructions

Your code is perfect but Vercel has NOT deployed the latest changes. Here's what to do RIGHT NOW:

## Option 1: Delete & Re-Import (Most Reliable - 5 minutes)

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click **yordlepedia-gg** project
3. Click **Settings** (top menu)
4. Scroll to bottom
5. Click **"Delete Project"** (red button)
6. Confirm deletion
7. Go back to dashboard
8. Click **"New Project"** or **"+ Add New"**
9. Click **"Continue with GitHub"**
10. Search for `yordlepedia` or find `ibeeeees/yordlepedia.gg`
11. Click **"Import"**
12. When prompted for settings, click **"Deploy"** (use defaults)
13. **WAIT** for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)

## Why This Works

Your GitHub has ALL the correct code:
- ✅ Full summoner endpoint with stats/matches/champions
- ✅ Privacy & TOS pages
- ✅ Correct vercel.json configuration

But Vercel's cache has the OLD version. Deleting and re-importing forces Vercel to:
1. Clone fresh from GitHub
2. Run build from scratch
3. Deploy latest code

## After Redeployment

Test these URLs:
- https://yordlepedia-gg.vercel.app/api/summoner?region=na1&name=ibes
  - Should return full profile with stats, matches, champions
- https://yordlepedia-gg.vercel.app/ 
  - Try searching for a summoner - should show rank, stats, match history, champion performance

## If That Doesn't Work

Alternative: Use Vercel CLI
```bash
cd /Users/ibe/WebstormProjects/yordlepedia.gg
vercel --prod --force
```

This manually uploads everything to Vercel and skips GitHub entirely.
